        <h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field in technology that aims to simulate human intelligence processes through machines, particularly computer systems. From self-driving cars to chatbots, AI is becoming an integral part of our daily lives. The potential of AI to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, education, and business is vast, offering new solutions to age-old problems.</p>
        <p>However, as with any powerful technology, AI presents a mix of both advantages and challenges. While AI can enhance efficiency and automate processes, it also raises concerns related to job displacement, privacy, and ethics. In this website, we will explore the pros and cons of AI, providing a balanced view of its impact on society and the future of technology.</p>
